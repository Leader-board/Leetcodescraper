## LeetCode statistics

This part lists the raw mean of every contest, and also grade cutoffs. What if LeetCode was a course and the contest determined your final grade? The "grade cutoffs" try to estimate what your grade in such a course would be.

The score of any one candidate can be calculated using the formula 50 * (points obtained/max points) + 50 * (number of participants - user's rank)/(number of participants).

The grade cutoffs are a very good way of historically looking at the curve of each contest - for instance, a low A+ cutoff would mean that not many got full points, while a high D- would mean that many skipped the contest or got zero points. What the grade cutoffs does *not* do is robustly track a person's performance - while it's indeed useful, ELO is typically a better measure.
